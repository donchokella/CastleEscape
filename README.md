This is my interpretation on the Funrado case study.


Unity 2021.3.16f1

I have left a note in line 104 of the PlayerController script stating "Dying Animation will be placed here" as I couldn't find the Dying Animation.

It would have been better to have indicators for the keys in the UI.

I believe it would be better to place the sound effects and animations within the GameManager.

I'm not very familiar with the concept of Field of View, so I largely based the FoV script on the following video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luLrhoTZYD8].

I am aware that it does not fully meet the design expectations. I tried to do my best with the knowledge I had. If we work together, I'm confident I can make rapid progress, especially in terms of design expectations.
